The data is present in the file named UndergradSurvey.xlsx

There is also an R file just in case if someone is intrested in coding -- UnderGradSurvey.R

This assigmnet is written so as to give people an idea about the descriptive statistics that plays acrucial role in EDA and other analytics 
fields. This assignment here gives a brief example of the following:


1.Managerial report describing the sample. (Sample statistics like mean, median mode, standard deviation and various proportions are sufficient)


2.Construct 95% confidence intervals for the following

i) Mean GPA

ii) Mean GPA for males and females separately

iii) Mean salary

iv) Mean salary for males and females separately

v) Mean spending

vi) Mean spending for males and females separately

vii) Mean wealth

viii) Mean wealth for males and females separately


3.Interpret the confidence intervals.


4.Conduct hypothesis testing for the following scenarios.

i) Salary expectation for male undergraduates is higher than salary expectation for female undergraduates

ii) Males will consider themselves rich with significantly higher wealth accumulation compared to females

iii) Females spend significantly less on textbooks and supplies compared to males

iv) Undergraduate students who have decided to go for graduate studies (Grad Intention = Yes) have a significantly higher GPA than 
others.
